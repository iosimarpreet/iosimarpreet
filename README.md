### Hi there 👋🏽

I'm Simarpreet, pronounced *simmer•preet*. I wander between the worlds of Data Science & Software Engineering, but I'm quite happy in engineering right now. I love python, have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript and enjoy working across the stack. 

Currently, I work at a healthcare-finance data analytics company building web-apps and machine learning systems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on fyiapp.io
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)-learning nodejs & really digging into vue (and front end in general)!
