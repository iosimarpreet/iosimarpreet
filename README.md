### Hi there 👋🏽

I'm Simarpreet, pronounced *simmer•preet*. I wander between the worlds of Data Science & Software Engineering, but I'm quite happy in engineering right now. I love python, have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript and enjoy working across the stack. 

Currently working at a healthcare-finance data analytics company building web-apps and machine learning systems.
